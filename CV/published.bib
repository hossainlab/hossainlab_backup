abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aims:&lt;/em&gt; The study aimed to assess perception of the students about antibiotic consumption and the rise of antibiotic resistance with the view to developing an effective community engagement strategy for antimicrobial stewardship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt; A cross-sectional study was carried out from July 2020 to November 2020. The students from Dhaka City, Bangladesh were approached through social media to complete an online questionnaire containing self-identification data, knowledge about antibiotics, attitudes toward antibiotics, and antibiotic consumption. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt; Out of the 472 survey participants, 24.6% of participants identified antibiotic side effects as the worst outcome, while 74.2% were unaware of the antibiotics’ long-term impact on global health. Participants believe antimicrobial stewardship and legal disciplinary action against indiscriminate use of antibiotics are the best strategies for countering the spread of antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt; This study has identified knowledge gaps and misconceptions about antibiotic resistance and prevention. In these situations, academics must play a role in training students about the dangers of antibiotic misuse, gathering public opinion in support of effective policy making, and enforcing guidelines and regulations across the healthcare, pharmaceutical, and agricultural industries to prevent the spread of superbugs.&lt;/p&gt;},

	abstract = {Background Thalassemia is the most common congenital single-gene condition. It is marked by a lack of or reduced synthesis of either the alpha- or beta-globin chains and passed down from parents to offspring. This study aimed to determine how healthy students in Bangladeshi public universities were aware of thalassemia and how they felt about it.Methods A cross-sectional descriptive online survey was conducted on public university students in Bangladesh using a structured questionnaire between June and November 2020. Students completed structured questionnaires consisting of three sections: demographic information, ten multiple-choice knowledge questions rated on a scale of 0 to 10, and ten attitude questions. The data were analyzed using Python. Descriptive statistics methods such as frequencies and percentages were used to present data.Results A total of 681 students participated in the online survey. The average age of the respondents in this study was 21.97 years, with a standard deviation of 2.9. Most of the students, 611(89.72\%), had heard about thalassemia. Only 248 (36.42\%) of the students had a fair understanding of thalassemia, with 138 (22.62\%) being male and 110 (18.03\%) being female (P-value = 0.0819). Students{\textquoteright} knowledge level did not differ significantly by gender (P-value = 0.0819), marital status (P-value = 0.2281), or academic year (P-value = 0.4619), but there was a substantial variation by field of study (0.0042). However, 478 (78.36\%) participants showed a positive attitude toward {\textquotedblleft}Premarital Screening{\textquotedblright} to prevent thalassemia.Conclusions In Bangladesh, where the rate of family marriage is high, it is recommended that university students and the general public engage in long-term, goal-oriented prevention measures. These initiatives would provide crucial information and increase people{\textquoteright}s awareness of thalassemia when married and after becoming parents, reducing the impacts of illnesses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe author(s) received no specific funding for this work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.Not ApplicableThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study adhered to the most significant ethical standards imaginable, and participants gave informed consent.

	abstract = {Background This study aimed to determine the knowledge about self-management and the effects of diabetes on the daily activities among adult patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in Bangladesh.Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to August 2021 on diabetic patients from Dhaka and the Rangpur district in Bangladesh. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from study participants. This study{\textquoteright}s researchers collected data via phone interview. The collected data was analyzed using Python (Version 3.8), Pandas, and ResearchPy (A Python package for research data analysis).Results Out of the 303 participants, all are middle-class service holders with an urban sedentary lifestyle. 69.64\% and 30.3\% are male and female, respectively, with 66\% having post-secondary education and 35\% having smoking habits. Most (68.32\%) had onset of diabetic symptoms between 36-50 years, 23.43\% with Type I and 41.9\% with Type II diabetes. However, 34.65\% of participants couldn{\textquoteright}t answer about their ailment definitively. 22.44\% of participants were on regular insulin shots within 3 months of the first diagnosis, and 90\% were satisfied with managing diabetes. However, 54.46\% admitted to adopting an altered lifestyle after becoming diabetic. Males and females with both types of diabetes showed significantly different comorbidities in a paired 2-tailed t-test (0.012 and 0.02 for Type I and Type II, respectively). The male participants showed higher incidences of cardiac issues, while females showed a higher propensity to hypertension. 85\% of participants were confident about their medication, course of management, prognosis, diet, and lifestyle for controlling diabetes.Conclusions The disparity in the number of male and female participants and the high percentage of participants with no factual information about their prognosis need to be targeted for further study, and a patient-friendly engagement/ information dissemination action plan should be helpful.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe author(s) received no specific funding for this work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study adhered to the most significant ethical standards imaginable, and participants gave informed consent.
