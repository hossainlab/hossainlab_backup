In particular, students with a life science background should learn the biocomputing workflow.\nWhat is Biocomputing?\rBiocomputing is an innovative branch of technology that functions at the interface of biology, engineering, and computer science. It tries to employ cells or their subcomponent molecules (such as DNA or RNA) to do activities normally performed by a computer.\n\rFeatures of Biocomputing\rBiocomputing (Bioinformatics) is placed at the intersection of Medicine, Biology, Applied Mathematics, and Computer Science. Those who have chosen this career are responsible for addressing global issues such as:\n\rSearch for methods of treatment of cancer, chronic and autoimmune diseases;\n\rExtending the life of the population, improving the ecological situation and searching for the longevity genome;\n\rDevelopment, planning, implementation of mathematical methods, algorithms and programs used for the analysis of medical and biological information;\n\rApplication of the obtained research and practice results.\n\r\r\rWhy Biocomputing?\rModern diagnostic and research techniques have led to a growth in the quantity of scientific data, which is extremely difficult to manually process. In this instance, Biocomputing (Bioinformatics) is of assistance. In the second part of the 20th century, it emerged as an interdisciplinary science. Biocomputing incorporates components of applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, mathematical and computer modeling, and programming.\nThe field is new and expanding rapidly, and it will continue to do so in the future since the use of computer methods assures great accuracy, speed, and eliminates the human element. There is a demand for biocomputing technology in biochemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, pharmacy,biophysics, ecology, pharmacology, agriculture, and genetics, among other fields.\n\rAdvantages of Biocomputing\rAll options are open to Biocomputing professionals, from local research institutions to reputable worldwide IT firms.\n\rBiocomputing specialists do not engage directly with patients or biological material, as their work involves mathematical methodologies and computer systems.\n\rKnowledge of programming languages and the fundamentals of applied mathematics enables Biocomputing professionals to quickly transition to other fields, such as traditional programming, genomic data science, software development, and testing.\n\rContinuous self-development and improvement of professional skills.\n\rThe ability to analyze data sets, knowing that the results of work in the long term will save the lives of thousands of people.\n\r\r\rSome Major Courses in Biocomputing\r\rIntroduction to Life Sciences \u0026amp; Bioinformatics\rApplied Mathematics\rWeb programming and Databases\rBioinformatics Lab I\rBioinformatics Lab II\rIntroduction to Programming Languages (Python, R, and Julia)\rFundamentals of Biostatistics\rData Science: Introduction\rMachine Learning (Artificial Intelligence)\r\r\rLeading Positions in Biocomputing\r\rData Analyst\rBioinformatician\rBioinformatics Scientist\rData Scientist\r\rWe are working on designing a biocomputing program at CHIRAL Bangladesh.

describing the shape of a distribution, we should consider:\n\rSymmetry/skewness of the distribution.\rPeakedness (modality) — the number of peaks (modes) the distribution has.\r\r\rSymmetric Distributions\rNote that all three distributions are symmetric, but are different in their modality (peakedness).\n\rThe first distribution is unimodal — it has one mode (roughly at 10) around which the observations are concentrated.\rThe second distribution is bimodal — it has two modes (roughly at 10 and 20) around which the observations are concentrated.\rThe third distribution is kind of flat, or uniform. The distribution has no modes, or no value around which the observations are concentrated. Rather, we see that the observations are roughly uniformly distributed among the different values.\r\r# Check distribution of age gghistogram(diabetes, x = \u0026quot;BMI\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;#665191\u0026quot;)\r\rSkewed Right Distributions\rA distribution is called skewed right if, as in the histogram above, the right tail (larger values) is much longer than the left tail (small values).\r# Check distribution of age gghistogram(diabetes, x = \u0026quot;Age\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;#665191\u0026quot;)\r\rSkewed Left Distributions\rA distribution is called skewed left if, as in the histogram above, the left tail (smaller values) is much longer than the right tail (larger values).\n# Check distribution of Glucose gghistogram(diabetes, x = \u0026quot;Glucose\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;#665191\u0026quot;)\rComments:\r- Distributions with more than two peaks are generally called multimodal.\r- Bimodal or multimodal distributions can be evidence that two distinct groups are represented.\r- Unimodal, Bimodal, and multimodal distributions may or may not be symmetric.\n\rCenter\rThe center of the distribution is often used to represent a typical value.\n# Check distribution of BMI gghistogram(diabetes, x = \u0026quot;BMI\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;#665191\u0026quot;, add = \u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;, add_density = TRUE)\r# Check distribution of BMI gghistogram(diabetes, x = \u0026quot;BMI\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;#665191\u0026quot;, add = \u0026quot;median\u0026quot;)\r\rSpread\rOne way to measure the spread (also called variability or variation) of the distribution is to use the approximate range covered by the data.\n# Check distribution of BloodPressure gghistogram(diabetes, x = \u0026quot;BloodPressure\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;#665191\u0026quot;, add = \u0026quot;median\u0026quot;)\r\rOutliers\rOutliers are observations that fall outside the overall pattern.\n# Check distribution of BloodPressure gghistogram(diabetes, x = \u0026quot;BloodPressure\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;#665191\u0026quot;, add = \u0026quot;median\u0026quot;)\r\r\rMeasures of Spread\r\rRange\rInter-Quartile Range (IQR)\rStandard Deviation\rProperties of the Standard Deviation\rChoosing Numerical Measures\r\rRange\rThe range covered by the data is the most intuitive measure of variability.

For example, we can present the percentiles or z-scores of an individual’s height and weight. These two measures together would provide a better picture of how the individual fits in the overall population than either would alone.\nAlthough measures of position are not stressed in this course as much as measures of center and spread, we have seen and will see many measures of position used in various aspects of examining the distribution of one variable and it is good to recognize them as measures of position when they appear.\n\r\rOutliers Detection\r\rUsing the IQR to Detect Outliers\rThe 1.5(IQR) Criterion for Outliers\rThe 3(IQR) Criterion for Outliers\rUnderstanding Outliers\r\rUsing the IQR to Detect Outliers\rSo far we have quantified the idea of center, and we are in the middle of the discussion about measuring spread, but we haven’t really talked about a method or rule that will help us classify extreme observations as outliers. The IQR is commonly used as the basis for a rule of thumb for identifying outliers.\n\rThe 1.5(IQR) Criterion for Outliers\rAn observation is considered a suspected outlier or potential outlier if it is:\n\rbelow Q1 – 1.5(IQR) or\rabove Q3 + 1.5(IQR)\r\rThe following picture (not to scale) illustrates this rule:\n\rThe 3(IQR) Criterion for Outliers\rAn observation is considered an EXTREME outlier if it is:\n\rbelow Q1 – 3(IQR) or\rabove Q3 + 3(IQR)\r\rds \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;data/500_Person_Gender_Height_Weight_Index.csv\u0026quot;)\rhead(ds)\r Gender Height Weight Index\r1 Male 174 96 4\r2 Male 189 87 2\r3 Female 185 110 4\r4 Female 195 104 3\r5 Male 149 61 3\r6 Male 189 104 3\rgghistogram(ds, x = \u0026quot;Height\u0026quot;)\rgghistogram(ds, x = \u0026quot;Weight\u0026quot;)\r\r\rBoxplots\r\rThe Five Number Summary\rThe Boxplot\rSide-By-Side (Comparative) Boxplots\r\rThe Five Number Summary\rSo far, in our discussion about measures of spread, some key players were:\n\rthe extremes (min and Max), which provide the range covered by all the data; and\rthe quartiles (Q1, M and Q3), which together provide the IQR, the range covered by the middle 50% of the data.\r\rRecall that the combination of all five numbers (min, Q1, M, Q3, Max) is called the five number summary, and provides a quick numerical description of both the center and spread of a distribution.\nds %\u0026gt;% summarise(\rmin = fivenum(Height)[1],\rQ1 = fivenum(Height)[2],\rmedian = fivenum(Height)[3],\rQ3 = fivenum(Height)[4],\rmax = fivenum(Height)[5])\r min Q1 median Q3 max\r1 140 156 170.5 184 199\r\rThe Boxplot\rThe central box spans from Q1 to Q3.

Note that the width of the box has no meaning.\r\rA line in the box marks the median M, which in our case is 35.\r\rLines extend from the edges of the box to the smallest and largest observations that were not classified as suspected outliers (using the 1.5xIQR criterion). In our example, we have no low outliers, so the bottom line goes down to the smallest observation, which is 21. Since we have three high outliers (61,74, and 80), the top line extends only up to 49, which is the largest observation that has not been flagged as an outlier.\r\r4. outliers are marked with asterisks (*).\rTo summarize: the following information is visually depicted in the boxplot:\nthe five number summary (blue)\rthe range and IQR (red)\routliers (green)\n\rSide-By-Side (Comparative) Boxplots\rggboxplot(ds, y = \u0026quot;Height\u0026quot;)\rggboxplot(ds, y = \u0026quot;Weight\u0026quot;)\rggboxplot(ds, x = \u0026quot;Gender\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Height\u0026quot;)\r\r\rThe “Normal” Shape\r\rThe Standard Deviation Rule\rVisual Methods of Assessing Normality\rStandardized Scores (Z-Scores)\r\rThe Standard Deviation Rule\r\rThe Standard Deviation Rule:\r\rApproximately 68% of the observations fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean.\rApproximately 95% of the observations fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.\rApproximately 99.7% (or virtually all) of the observations fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean.\r\r\r\rVisual Methods of Assessing Normality\r\rStandardized Scores (Z-Scores)\rZ = (x - mean) / standard deviation\nds %\u0026gt;% mutate(zscore = (Height - mean(Height)) / sd(Height)) %\u0026gt;% head() \r Gender Height Weight Index zscore\r1 Male 174 96 4 0.2476907\r2 Male 189 87 2 1.1637067\r3 Female 185 110 4 0.9194357\r4 Female 195 104 3 1.5301130\r5 Male 149 61 3 -1.2790025\r6 Male 189 104 3 1.1637067\r\r\r\rRole Type Classification\rWhile it is fundamentally important to know how to describe the distribution of a single variable, most studies pose research questions that involve exploring the relationship between two (or more) variables. These research questions are investigated using a sample from the population of interest.\nExample Research Question(s)\rIs there a relationship between gender and test scores on a particular standardized test? Other ways of phrasing the same research question:\r\r\rIs performance on the test related to gender?\rIs there a gender effect on test scores?\rAre there differences in test scores between males and females?\r\rAre the smoking habits of a person (yes, no) related to the person’s gender(male, female)?\r\r\rRole of a Variable in a Study\rIn most studies involving two variables, each of the variables has a role. We distinguish between:\n\rResponse variable — the outcome of the study; and\rEexplanatory variable — the variable that claims to explain, predict or affect the response.\r\rAs we mentioned earlier the variable we wish to predict is commonly called the dependent variable, the outcome variable, or the response variable. Any variable we are using to predict (or explain differences) in the outcome is commonly called an explanatory variable, an independent variable, a predictor variable, or a covariate.\nTypically the explanatory variable is denoted by X, and the response variable by Y.\nExample\rResearch Question: Is there a relationship between gender and test scores on a particular standardized test? Other ways of phrasing the same research question:\r\r\rIs performance on the test related to gender?\n\rIs there a gender effect on test scores?\n\rAre there differences in test scores between males and females?\n\rGender is the explanatory variable\n\rTest score is the response variable\n\r\r\r\rRole-Type Classification\rIf we further classify each of the two relevant variables according to type (categorical or quantitative), we get the following 4 possibilities for “role-type classification”\n\rCategorical explanatory and quantitative response (Case CQ)\rCategorical explanatory and categorical response (Case CC)\rQuantitative explanatory and quantitative response (Case QQ)\rQuantitative explanatory and categorical response (Case QC)\r\r\rFigure 1: Figure Caption\r\rExample\rResearch Question: Is there a relationship between gender and test scores on a particular standardized test?

When identifying the form, we try to find the simplest way to describe the shape of the scatterplot. There are many possible forms. Here are a couple that are quite common:\rRelationships with a linear form are most simply described as points scattered about a line:\n\rFigure 5: Figure Caption\r\rA scatterplot in which the points are slightly above or below a line which has been drawn through the points. Overall, the points create a shape that appears to be a fat line. In this example, the points create a negative relationship.Relationships with a non-linear (sometimes called curvilinear) form are most simply described as points dispersed around the same curved line:\n\rFigure 6: Figure Caption\r\rThere are many other possible forms for the relationship between two quantitative variables, but linear and curvilinear forms are quite common and easy to identify. Another form-related pattern that we should be aware of is clusters in the data:\n\rStrength\r\rFigure 7: Figure Caption\r\rThe strength of the relationship is determined by how closely the data follow the form of the relationship. Let’s look, for example, at the following two scatterplots displaying positive, linear relationships:\nThe strength of the relationship is determined by how closely the data points follow the form. We can see that in the left scatterplot the data points follow the linear pattern quite closely. This is an example of a strong relationship. In the right scatterplot, the points also follow the linear pattern, but much less closely, and therefore we can say that the relationship is weaker. In general, though, assessing the strength of a relationship just by looking at the scatterplot is quite problematic, and we need a numerical measure to help us with that. We will discuss that later in this section.\n\rFigure 8: Figure Caption\r\rData points that deviate from the pattern of the relationship are called outliers. We will see several examples of outliers during this section. Two outliers are illustrated in the scatterplot below:\n\rFigure 9: Figure Caption\r\rggscatter(data, x = \u0026quot;Height\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Weight\u0026quot;, shape = 21, size = 3, add = \u0026quot;reg.line\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;lightgray\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;Gender\u0026quot;)\r\r\r\r","date":1658966400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658955533,"objectID":"36ebce317663acc8bfa48a956c3c633f","permalink":"https://hossainlab.github.io/2022/07/28/interpreting-data-using-descriptive-statistics-with-r/","publishdate":"2022-07-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2022/07/28/interpreting-data-using-descriptive-statistics-with-r/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction\rExploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.\nExploratory data analysis (EDA) methods are often called Descriptive Statistics due to the fact that they simply describe, or provide estimates based on, the data at hand.\nExploratory Data Analysis\r\r“Exploratory data analysis can never be the whole story, but nothing else can serve as the foundation stone.","tags":["Biostatistics with R"],"title":"Interpreting Data Using Descriptive Statistics with R","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Talks"],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1658966400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658966400,"objectID":"39df5f240159e9ee1600df3e30894671","permalink":"https://hossainlab.github.io/talk/state-the-art-of-microbial-genome-analysis/","publishdate":"2022-07-28T03:13:48+06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/state-the-art-of-microbial-genome-analysis/","section":"talk","summary":"Genomics is the study of whole genomes of organisms, and incorporates elements from ge- netics.
